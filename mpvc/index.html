    <strong>On playing URLs, Wed 30 Mar 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    What got me started on using mpvc is being able to play URLs. This is the cause to start writing what you are reading now (this repo at https://github.com/gmt4/mpvc/)

    <strong>On securing mpv socket location, Mon 14 Nov 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    One thing that bothers me when using mpvc, is that most programs performing ipc on mpv socket, just leave the socket at /tmp/mpvsocket. A better default location for the mpv socket is $HOME/.config/mpvc/mpvsocket
    </p>

    <strong>On load/save functionality, Fri 18 Nov 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    A thing that I'd like to be able to do is to perform mpvc load/save of the playlist, and, be able of manipulating the playlist using standard Unix commands eg. grep. The easiest way that comes to mind, is something a la: mpvc save | grep -v artist | mpvc load. This enables to filter out an artist, and drop all the songs by this artist.

    <strong>On persistent mpv startup, Sun 20 Nov 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    One particular feature where improvement could be done mpvc -a audio.opus is finishes playing audio.opus, mpv terminates, and, the current playlist is lost. This happens as mpv is started with --idle=once. A workaround for this is to start, mpv separately. For my use of mpvc I think mpvc should start mpv separately and keep it running once playing finishes

    <strong>On a minimal mpvc-tui, Sat 03 Dec 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    One thing I keep doing a lot, is typing mpvc status and mpvc -i, to check the mpv playlist and status. To this end I've quickly hacked a minimal TUI https://github.com/gmt4/mpvc/blob/master/mpvc-tui, that continuously shows the mpvc playlist & status. In addition, while in mpvc-tui you can Control+C, to get a mpvc prompt to run quick mpvc commands, like: prev, next, pause, toggle, seek, volume, etc.
    </p>

    <strong>On using the mpvc-tui prompt, Wednesday 13 Dec 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    As explained above, mpvc-tui does three things: 1) display status, 2) display playlist, 3) prompt the user for interaction.

    Once we hit Control+C, and land on the user prompt, the following can be done:
    <ol>
    <li> run mpvc commands starting with "mpvc". This allows for manipulating the mpv/mpvc status. The commands run with "mpvc" have QUIETFLAG=true set, to not clutter the mpvc-tui.
    <li> run shell commands internally starting with "!". This allows for commands that manipulate mpvc-tui program, such as changing the working directory, with cd/pwd. This also allows for starting your favorite editor to configure the mpvc-tui look and feel with: "!$EDITOR $MPVC_CONFIG".
    <li> run shell commands externally starting with "!!". This allows for running commands on a separate shell. This gives room for more complex commands, like starting alsamixer to manipulate audio levels, change outputs with `pactl(1)`, etc.
    <li> quit the mpvc-tui, by typing quit, exit, or "q".
    </ol>

    When using the mpvc-tui prompt for some time, one notices that there's a lot of repetition of commands. To address repetition, one solution is to use a history file of past commands, and completion of commands & filenames. This can be achieved using `rlwrap(1)` in one shot mode that becomes a life-saver. Now, you get a more comfortable prompt, where TAB completion works on commands and filenames, as well as Control+R to repeat previous commands in the history file.
    </p>

    <strong>On using the mpvc-tui -x launcher, Thursday 14 Dec 2022 ✓</strong>
    <p>
    Another nifty detail of mpvc-tui, is that it can be quickly spawn from the WM launcher by using `mpvc-tui -x`, then type a few mpvc commands to setup music, and close it. Or it can be started on the current terminal with `mpvc-tui` and left running as a long running program, and get back to it when needed.
